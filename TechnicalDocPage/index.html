        <p>This is a straigtforward summary about all you need to know about JavaScript. So let's get into it...</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language commonly used in web development to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables developers to manipulate the content and behavior of web pages in real-time, allowing for features like form validation, animations, interactive maps, and much more.</p>
        <p>As a client-side scripting language, JavaScript runs in the user's web browser, meaning that it can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to dynamically modify its structure, content, and style. Additionally, JavaScript can be used on the server-side through platforms like Node.js, expanding its capabilities beyond just browser-based applications.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is known for its versatility and flexibility, as it can be integrated with HTML and CSS seamlessly. It is also supported by all major web browsers, making it a widely adopted choice for web development projects.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>JavaScript provides several data types to work with, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more. These data types allow developers to store and manipulate different kinds of information within their programs. For example, numbers are used for mathematical calculations, strings for text manipulation, and booleans for logical operations.</p>
        <p>In order to understand, JavaScript (the programming language that provides intercativity in the Internet), first you need to understand the data types and the variables of the language and how they are created. It would be really helpful when, where and how to use them.</p>
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <div class="callout_box">Variables help you remember the value of something for a later use in your code! </div>
        <p>You can create a variable by following the syntax <code> [keyword]  [name] </code>. Example:</p>
        <div class="code_box">
            <code>
              <span class="variable">var</span> aVariable;
            </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p>Functions in JavaScript allow developers to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. They can accept parameters as input and return values as output, providing a way to organize and modularize code. Functions can be declared using the function keyword or defined as arrow functions for more concise syntax.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Methods">
        <header>Methods</header>
        <p>Methods in JavaScript are functions that are associated with objects. They allow for the manipulation of object properties and behavior. Methods are accessed using dot notation, where the method name is followed by parentheses to indicate that it should be executed.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Making_Decisions">
        <header>Making Decisions</header>
        <p>Making decisions in JavaScript involves using conditional statements such as <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code>, and <code>else</code>. These statements allow developers to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions. Conditional statements evaluate expressions to either true or false, determining which branch of code to execute.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <p>Arrays are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript used to store collections of values. They allow developers to group related data together under a single variable name and provide methods for manipulating and iterating over the elements within them.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>Loops in JavaScript are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. The <code>for</code> loop, <code>while</code> loop, and <code>do-while</code> loop are common looping constructs used to iterate over arrays, objects, or perform tasks until a certain condition is met. Loops provide a way to automate repetitive tasks and process data efficiently.</p>
